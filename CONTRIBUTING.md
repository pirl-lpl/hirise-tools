CONTRIBUTING
============

These tools should be easy to obtain, install, and use by a wide variety of
users with a wide variety of skills and with possibly zero system admin support!

-	Generally keep these tools as free of external dependencies as possible;
	well-known or bundled modules/libraries should be fine (e.g., Perl includes
	a bunch of bundled modules that every Perl installation probably has -
	those are okay).

-	If an external dependency is unavoidable and your app's language doesn't
	have a convenient built-in way to obtain it, please provide one.

-	These tools should not require a build step.

-	These tools should use languages and interpreters that are likely to be
	already installed on a user's system. Perl, Python, bash shell scripts are
	good choices. Node.js, while pretty cool, is probably not a good choice.

-	Make sure you have the rights and permissions to contribute tools to this
	repo. The repo itself is nominally licensed under the Apache 2.0 license
	(http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0), but individual applications
	can be licensed under alternative licenses.
